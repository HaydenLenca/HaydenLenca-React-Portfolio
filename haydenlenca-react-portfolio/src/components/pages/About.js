      <p>Hello everyone, in this section I will tell you a little about me. I grew up in Michigan and moved to Arizona to pursue a better life path.
      after spending a few years saving money I decided to get into web development. After trying on my own it became very frustrating.
      On the verge of giving up I decided to take a bootcamp from MSU to get me on the path to greatness. Now here I am building web pages and pursuing the path that will be a great achievement.
