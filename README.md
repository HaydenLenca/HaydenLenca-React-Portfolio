# <My Portfolio>

## Description

Starting this journey has been a lot to take in and learn. Seeing how you can get a page together it is a great accomplishment.
With this project I have a portfolio page with an about me section, my first projects and contact. Over time it will be updated to look cleaner and add more of my projects.
